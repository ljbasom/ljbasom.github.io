## Welcome to my final STAT 184 final project website!

For this final project, I posed the question:

**Could relevant firearm permit numbers for a series of years have some explanation for trends in violent crime in the United States as well as hunting trends in Pennsylvania?**

In order to answer these questions, I was able to find 3 data sources from various locations on the Internet that give enough information to create some useful plots. If you would like to see them, please click the following links:

* [NICS Firearm Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/master/data/nics-firearm-background-checks.csv)
* [Pennsylvania Hunting Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljbasom/Final-Project/master/PAHuntingData.csv)
* [United States Crime Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljbasom/Final-Project/master/USCrime.csv)

To view all of the files in one location, as well as see different stages of my progress, please visit my [Final Project Github repository](https://github.com/ljbasom/Final-Project).

Below you will find a fully functional version of my final project, created directly from my Final Project notebook HTML file!
